## idea for final project 
a multiple variable analysis of what factors most in the NBA MVP race over the last 10 years.
4 variables: Points per game, team record (w-l %), player defensive rating or defensive vorp, average +/- (BOX +/-) or assists+rebounds per game or assist to turnover ratio.
some of these things are in fact interconnected but using our brains, we can separate them and see which ones are more connected to where a player lands in MVP voting.
